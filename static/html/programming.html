            <p>
                <b>Coding is something that makes a difference.</b> When you code, you get this feeling that you are
                helping people. Through code you can create something that people interact with, use, touch, and work
                with. When you manage to build something that solves problems, you know that you are making a difference
                in someone else's life. That is an amazing feeling.
            </p>

                    <em>"Team work. The community of software developers is much closer knit than most
                        professions."</em> There are plenty of meetups and networking events for every niche of
                    programming. There is also a huge community that supports programmers online, so you never code
                    alone. Besides that, working as a developer you can actually involve a great deal of interaction
                    with others across the business. That includes designers, managers, clients, and users. These people
                    usually have a different viewpoint on programming which in some cases annoys the programmer. But
                    let's stay positive, experience working in a team is invaluable as it helps you to become more
                    versatile as a professional, therefore more valuable as an employee. Besides that, you can also find
                    a lot of inspiration coming out from a non-technical level. Last but not least, <u>coding as a
                        career has no boundaries and knows no countries</u>, therefore programmers are usually
                    surrounded by international folks. Which is -- now I am talking from my own experience -- pretty
                    amazing!

                <b>Problem solving.</b> The sense of accomplishment when solving a really complicated problem cannot be
                beaten. There are always new problems to solve, solutions to find, and bugs to fix. The non-repeating
                nature of the subject implies that each new challenge you solve will teach you something new in return
                and make you a better programmer.
